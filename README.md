# salmon_pipeline
salmon_pipeline is an pipeline for running "salmon", and merging the data from salmon for further analyses.

## Description
Salmon generates data for TPM and read count for each sample, but in many cases, combined data for all samples is required for further expression analysis. Using salmon_pipeline, you can obtain merged data files for both TPM and read count.
