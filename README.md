# salmon_pipeline
salmon_pipeline is a pipeline for running "salmon" and merging the data from salmon for further analyses.

## Description
Salmon generates data for TPM and read count for each sample, but in many cases, combined data for all samples is required for further expression analyss. Using salmon_pipeline, you can obtain merged data files for both TPM and read count.

## Usage
All the files of salmon_pipeline are needed to place in the directory containing the reference index for running salmon (Default: salmon_ref_index).
